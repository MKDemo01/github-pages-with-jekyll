# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad :smiley: you are here. I plan to talk about the following:

1) Documentation
2) Training Courses
3) Blockchain


### 1. Documentation
It appears that you can create a separate branch within an existing repository in order to display that repository's documentation.
However, how can this branch be maintained together with the existing project code but only function as a static site?

### 2. Training Courses
There are numerous courses to be taken, including:
* HTML / CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Docker / Kubernetes
* Solidity

### 3. Blcokchain
There appear to be a number of blockchains that are useful for actually processing transactions beyond the functionatlity of a
simple ledger as offered by BitCoin, for example **Ethereuem**, **Ripple (XRP)**, and **Diem**.
